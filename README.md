# Python-AI-voice-notification
AI, c, python, embedded
This project shows real world example of Cloud computing, Machine learning and IOT.

A system is made using arduino and many type of different sensors.
A AI based Voice assistant is made using Python and Microsoft davids voice.
A serial communication is set between PC and NodeMCU microcontroller board.
Data collected by NodeMCU is uploaded to cloud and blynk cloud simultaneously.
The Ai is shell based and we can start it by running the python program.
we can then ask question from AI and based on the data from the cloud, the AI will respond.
Language used: Python, C. Tech used: Blynk cloud, ThingSpeak cloud.
